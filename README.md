# COMPAS-Based-Recidivism-Modelling
Developed a predictive modeling system using an XGBClassifier to assess recidivism risk based on demographic and criminal history data from the COMPAS dataset. Streamlined data processing and hyperparameter tuning to evaluate model performance and identify potential algorithmic biases across diverse demographic groups.
